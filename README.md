# This is my portfolio website made with React

Having previously made this with vanilla HTML-CSS, then with Javascript and Bootstrap, this is now the latest portfolio design made with React and Bootstrap.


You can find the previous versions of my portfolio websites in my git repositories, however they will miss the latest projects since I don't update those portfolios anymore.

I designed my portfolio website to showcase my knowledge of React and Bootstrap and also showcase my familiarity with different programming languages and projects made with them.

Hope you enjoy and feel free to contact me in the ways you prefer from the contact section of my website.

Thanks :)
